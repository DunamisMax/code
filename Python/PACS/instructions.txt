Absolutely! Here's a project guide for building a foundational DICOM PACS viewer and database using Python. Keep in mind that a full-fledged PACS is quite complex, so this will focus on core elements to get you started.

**Project Structure**

```
dicom_pacs/
    ├── viewer.py               # Main script for the viewer application
    ├── database.py             # Database interaction functions
    ├── dicom_utils.py          # DICOM file processing and network functions 
    ├── config.py               # Project settings (database credentials, etc.)
    ├── requirements.txt        # List of Python dependencies
    └── data/                   # Folder to store sample DICOM images (for testing)
```

**Technology Choices**

* **DICOM:** pydicom ([https://pydicom.github.io/](https://pydicom.github.io/))
* **Database:** SQLite (for simplicity, but you could upgrade to PostgreSQL or MySQL)
* **GUI:** PyQt (flexible GUI framework, another option is Tkinter)
* **Image Processing:** Pillow (basic), OpenCV (more advanced)

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Setup**
   * Create a project directory.
   * Set up a virtual environment (recommended).
   * `pip install pydicom PyQt5 sqlite3` (plus others you'll need later)

2. **DICOM Handling (`dicom_utils.py`)**
   * **Loading:**  
      ```python
      import pydicom

      def load_dicom_image(file_path):
          ds = pydicom.dcmread(file_path)
          return ds
      ```
   * **Extracting Key Metadata:**
      ```python
      def get_patient_name(ds):
          return ds.get('PatientName', '')  
      # ... similar functions for study date, modality, etc.
      ```
   * **(Optional) Basic Image Processing:** (use Pillow or OpenCV)

3. **Database (`database.py`)**
   * **Schema Design:** 
       * Table: `studies` (study_id, patient_name, study_date, modality, ...)
       * Table: `images` (image_id, study_id, file_path, ...)
   * **SQLite Functions:**
      ```python
      import sqlite3

      def create_connection():
          # ... connect to your database
      
      def insert_study(conn, study_data):
          # ... SQL INSERT query 
      # ... Similar for insert_image, query_studies
      ```

4. **Viewer GUI (`viewer.py`)**
   * **Layout (PyQt):**
      * Image Display Area (Consider a custom widget or using PyQt's graphics capabilities)
      * Patient/Study List 
      * Basic Image Controls (Zoom, Pan, Windowing)
   * **Load Image:**
      * Connect a "Load DICOM" button to a function that uses `load_dicom_image`
      * Extract image pixel data from the DICOM dataset and display it.
   * **Database Integration:**
       * Display study list from database queries.
       * Store new images into the database.

5. **Configuration (`config.py`)**
   * Store database connection strings.
   * Paths or settings relevant to the project

**Notes and Extensions**

* **Testing:** Get sample DICOM files for development. You can find some online.
* **DICOM Network:** Explore pydicom's network features to receive images from other modalities.
* **Optimization:**  Profile your code for image loading and rendering bottlenecks.
* **Advanced Visualization:** Consider VTK or other 3D visualization libraries.
* **Web Interface:**  Explore Flask or Django to create a web-based viewer.
