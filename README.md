# My C Learning Journey

This repository is where I document my progress and practice as I learn the C programming language.

## Why C?

* C is a foundational language with widespread relevance in systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
* Understanding C provides insights into lower-level programming concepts and memory management.

## Goals

* Master core C syntax and constructs
* Develop proficiency with pointers and memory allocation
* Explore common data structures and algorithms in C
* Build small but practical C projects

## Contents

* **concepts:** Short code examples demonstrating specific C concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).
* **exercises:** Solutions to practice problems from various resources.
* **projects:** Small-scale programs applying C concepts (e.g., simple calculator, text processing tools).

## Notes

* I'm open to feedback and suggestions as I learn.
* Feel free to use any of the code here for your own learning purposes!
